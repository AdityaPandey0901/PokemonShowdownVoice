## Use the Code
To use this code for your games, you need 3 things:
1. Get started by cloning a Node 10 showdown server, such as the one here: https://github.com/smogon/pokemon-showdown
2. For configuring the game to work with the online server (play.pokemonshowdown.com), use the simple server configuration + authentication guide: https://poke-env.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#configuring-a-showdown-server
3. Lastly, you'll need an Open AI API Key, stored in the Key.txt file.
